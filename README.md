# TireChallenge

Task
Write a program that, given the desired pressure entered by the driver and the tire pressure read by the pump, indicates the difference between the desired pressure and the pressure read.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N that indicates the pressure desired by the driver (1 ≤ N ≤ 40). The second line contains an integer M that indicates the pressure read by the pump (1 ≤ M ≤ 40).

Exit
Your program should print a single line, containing the difference between the desired pressure and the read pressure.
